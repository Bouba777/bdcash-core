<p style="text-align: center;">JS implementation of main wallet features.</p>

<br>This is the main client side library of BDCash Blockchain, written in NodeJS.

You can use this version by installing it directly from npm:

```npm install --save @bdeco/core```

# Use your own Nodesh

To override the Nodesh list you've to rewrite the array like this:

```
let BDCashCore = require('@bdeco/core')
let bdcash = new BDCashCore
bdcash.staticnodes = true
bdcash.mainnetNodesh = ['http://localhost:3001', 'https://anothernode.com']
```

# BDCash-Core CLI (WIP)

If you want to use the module as a CLI you have to run:

```sudo npm link```

Then you'll be able to run commands like:
```bdcash getinfo```

This feature is a work in progress and will be released soon.
